Test project to practice JS iterators &amp; generators

# Introduction
This is a simple test project I built with JavaScript to practice iterators and generators. On loading it offers you to pick a card. Then "The Magician" tries to "guess" which card you picked. It doesn't really tries to guess though. It just shows you every card one by one in the same order every time, asking if that's your card. 

The master branch is the generator vesion. The iterator branch is the iterator vesion. Otherwise this programm functions the same.
